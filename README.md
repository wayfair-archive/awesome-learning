# Awesome Learning

## Quick Start

#### Start Developing

Navigate into your new site’s directory and start it up.
```sh
gatsby develop
```

#### Open the source code and start editing!

Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

Note: You'll also see a second link: `http://localhost:8000/___graphql`. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql).
