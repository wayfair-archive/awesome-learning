  questions: 
    - description: What, if anything, is wrong with the below code snippet?
      codeSnippet: |
        function anAsyncCall() {
          var promise = doSomethingAsync();
          promise.then(function() {
            somethingComplicated();
          });
          return promise;
        }
      choices:
      - value: It will throw a syntax error
      - value: Any error raised in the somethingComplicated() method will not get caught.
      - value: Nothing, it's perfectly fine
      correctChoices: 
      - 1
      explanation: If 'somethingComplicated()' throws an error, there is no 'catch' statement on its containing promise that will 'catch' the error.

    - description: True or false? Promise.all is rejected if any of the elements are rejected.
      choices:
      - value: 'true'
      - value: 'false'
      correctChoices: 
      - 0
      explanation: If any promise provided to Promise.all rejects, the promise it returns will also be rejected.

    - description: What gets logged to the console in the Promise.race function?
      codeSnippet: |
        var p1 = new Promise(function (resolve, reject) {
          setTimeout(resolve, 500, 'one');
        }); 
        var p2 = new Promise(function (resolve, reject) {
          setTimeout(resolve, 100, 'two');
        }); 
        Promise.race([p1, p2]).then(function (value) {
          console.log(value);
        });
      choices:
      - value: 'one'
      - value: 'two'
      correctChoices: 
      - 1
      explanation: As 'p2' resolves first with a value of 'two', that is what Promise.race will resolve with.
