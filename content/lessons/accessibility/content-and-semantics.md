  questions: 
    - description: What is a landmark ARIA role?
      choices:
      - value: It's a role at the top of the page that describes, to assistive technology, what the page is about
      - value: It's a role that provides meaning and context to sections of a page
      - value: It is used on decorative, non-interactive media (images or videos) to describe their meaning to assitive technology
      - value: An object describing the output of the function passed to useCallback
      correctChoices:

      - value: 'True'
      - value: 'False'
      correctChoices: 
      - 0
      explanation: Semantic elements have built-in functionality, including ARIA roles, that inherently make websites more accessible. 'div' elements are generic elements with no ARIA roles, outside of ones you manually provide it.
