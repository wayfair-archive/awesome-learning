      codeSnippet: |
        function foo() {
          var a = 2;
          function bar() {
            console.log(a);
          }
          return bar;
        }
        var baz = foo();
        baz();
      choices:
      - value: It will throw a reference error
      - value: It will log "undefined"
      - value: it will log the function definition of `foo`
      - value: It will log '2'
      correctChoices:
      - 3
      explanation: When 'foo' is executed, the variable 'a' is declared with a value of 2. When the function 'baz' is executed, the function 'bar' (returned by 'foo') remembers that it has the variable 'a' in its scope, and returns its value of 2.
