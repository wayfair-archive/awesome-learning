description: "Why do we need automated tests? Here's one good reason: You're going to test your changes anyway, why not automate it? In other words: you're going to
click around and make sure everything is working as expected before you commit
your code. As your project grows, you'll have more and more cases to test
manually. In most cases it's simple to automate this process and avoid manually
checking your work."
