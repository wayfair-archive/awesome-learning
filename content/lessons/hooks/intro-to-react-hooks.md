  The first question you see after browsing through your news and hearing conversations from your fellow engineers is what are Hooks? What can you do with Hooks? How do they compare to writing React with classes? These questions, and more, will be covered in this lesson.

    description: A code-focused and interactive introduction to Hooks. This introduces our first hook, useState, which allows us to maintain the state of a variable(s) within a component, similar to how "setState" in a Class Component works.

  questions: 
    - description: Which of the following scenarios describe a correct usage of the useState Hook? Check all that apply.
      choices:
      - value: Calling useState from within a Class Component
      - value: Calling useState from within a Function Component
      - value: Calling useState from within an if/else statement
      - value: Calling useContext from within useState
      - value: Calling useState from within a forEach statement on an array whose length can change
      correctChoices: 
      - 1
      - 3
      explanation: One of the core rules of React Hooks is that they should be called the same number of times between renders of a component. If a hook needs to not apply its logic if some condition is true or false, that logic should live within the hook itself (and not above it.) Class Components are not compatible with Hooks, and will cause a runtime error.

    - description: Which of the following snippets of code represent a valid implementation of useState that allows the button to function?
      codeSnippet: |
        import React, {useState} from 'react';

        // ‚¨áÔ∏è‚¨áÔ∏è‚¨áÔ∏è Snippets begin ‚¨áÔ∏è‚¨áÔ∏è‚¨áÔ∏è
        // 1.
        const count, setCount = useState();

        // 2. 
        const [count, setCount] = useState();

        // 3. 
        const setCount = useState(0);

        // 4.
        const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

        // 5.
        import {count, setCount} from useState();
        // ‚¨ÜÔ∏è‚¨ÜÔ∏è‚¨ÜÔ∏è Snippets end ‚¨ÜÔ∏è‚¨ÜÔ∏è‚¨ÜÔ∏è

        // üí° Choose the correct code snippet that allows 
        // üí° the below React to work correctly!

        function handleButtonClick() {
          const newCount = count + 1;
          setCount(newCount);
        }
        return (
          <section>
            <h1>The count is {count}</h1>
            <button onClick={handleButtonClick}>
              Click me!
            </button>
          </section>
        );
      choices:
      - value: 'Snippet 1'
      - value: 'Snippet 2'
      - value: 'Snippet 3'
      - value: 'Snippet 4'
      - value: 'Snippet 5'
      correctChoices: 
      - 3
      explanation: |
        Snippet 1 will result in a JavaScript syntax error. Snippet 2, while not incorrect, does not provide an initial value to 'useState', which will produce an initial value of 'count' as 'undefined'. When trying to increment the value in 'handleButtonClick', incrementing 'count' by one will return 'NaN'. Snippet 3 is missing an array destructuring statement, and Snippet 5 attempts to import the functionality of useState as if it could be imported, when instead it must be array-destructured.

    - description: True or False - You can update state (with a function returned from useState) within a useEffect hook.
      choices:
      - value: 'True'
      - value: 'False'
      correctChoices: 
      - 1
      explanation: You can do this, but remember to specify values in the second argument to useEffect. The hook will then only run when any value in the second argument changes. If you don't, you will enter into an infinite loop (as changing the state triggers a re-render, which calls the useEffect hook.)
      type: radio
    - description: When you return a function from within a useEffect call, when does this function get executed?
      choices:
      - value: When the component mounts
      - value: When the component's children are mounted
      - value: When the component unmounts
      - value: When the component throws an error
      - value: When a value in useEffect's dependency array changes
      correctChoices: 
      - 2
      - 4
      explanation: The function returned by useEffect is executed when the component unmounts, and when it is re-rendered due to a change in dependencies.
