description: "By the end of this session you will learn about all of the available 'Types' in
the language and the differences between == (loose equality) and === (strict equality) operators. 
We will also learn the important differences between
_Primitive_ and _Object_ types and how type coercion works."

    Equality" and "Strict Equality" sections are important for our session, the
    rest is useful but not necessary. Some interesting links to the JavaScript
    specification if you are up for a more academic explanation!'

    types is no different, it is quick and to the point. Some of the later parts
    of this blog will be helpful in the following sessions as well. Checkout the

    once in a while. This is also a great reference."

preReadQuiz:
  description: Take this quiz to test your understanding of JavaScript Types and Equality!
  questions: 
    - description: What operator should you use to find the type of a value in JavaScript?
      choices:
      - value: typeof
      - value: gettype
      - value: is
      - value: instanceof
      correctChoices: 
      - 0
      explanation: The 'typeof' operator is used to determine the type of a variable. 'gettype' and 'is' are not valid operators, and 'instanceof' tests whether a provided object has the same prototype constructor as a provided argument. 
      type: radio
    - description: As of ES2015, how many built-in types are defined by JavaScript?
      choices:
      - value: '7'
      - value: '4'
      - value: '6'
      - value: '5'
      - value: '3'
      correctChoices: 
      - 0
      explanation: As of ES2015, the seven types are 'number', 'boolean', 'string', 'null', 'object', 'undefined', and 'Symbol'.
      type: radio
    - description: True or false? In JavaScript, _variables_ do not have types, only _values_ have types.
      choices:
      - value: 'True'
      - value: 'False'
      correctChoices: 
      - 0
      explanation: In JavaScript, values have types, but variables (which refer to values) do not.
      type: radio
