    Equality" and "Strict Equality" sections are important for our session, the
    rest is useful but not necessary. Some interesting links to the JavaScript
    specification if you are up for a more academic explanation!'

    types is no different, it is quick and to the point. Some of the later parts

    reading). You can skim through it, but it might be worth reading through it
    once in a while. This is also a great reference."
