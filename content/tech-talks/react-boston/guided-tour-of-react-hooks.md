  Hooks offer a simple, concise way to write stateful React components without classes.

  In this talk you'll learn about the "magic" behind how Hooks work and get to see a few examples of them in action. We'll cover the big four: useState, useEffect, useReducer, and useContext, plus how to write your very own custom hooks.

  You may never want to write a class again.
