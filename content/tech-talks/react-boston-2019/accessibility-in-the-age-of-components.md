title: Accessibility in the Age of Components

description: |
  We often build component libraries to improve consistency, collaboration, and customization for a given product. 
  But what if a component library could also scale accessibility across the entire organization? 
  Building accessible components can help distribute responsibility across all of design and engineering, 
  without needing everyone to be an expert on the nitty-gritty details. 
  In this session, we'll go through specific component examples and use cases to help you and your team contribute 
  to a better, more inclusive web.
