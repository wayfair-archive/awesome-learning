  CSS is a great language and has improved a lot in the past decade but it still has the same global nature as in its early days. CSS was designed to style documents, and that often causes issues in large scale applications. Naming conventions, like BEM, CSS Modules and later CSS in JS significantly improved the maintainability of styles, but we can go one step further. Using components to create responsive Flexbox and Grid layouts can simplify code, improve developer experience and it feels natural in React.

  In this talk we’ll explore how to create any kind of page layout with just three generic components: Box, Flex and Stack.
