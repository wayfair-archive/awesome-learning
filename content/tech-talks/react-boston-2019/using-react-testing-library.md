  If you had to rewrite your tests when writing a hook in your React application, then you're writing tests wrong.

  react-testing-library is what it sounds like, but more importantly, it encourages writing tests in the way that your end users will be using your components.

  In this talk, I will first introduce react-testing-library, what it is, what it encourages, and what it does best. I'll then dive into how to effectively test a react component, first a smaller component, then a "larger" component with redux, i18n dependencies, etc., then I will show all of the different APIs that react-testing-library provides, and how to effectively use them. Then, I'll show how to write effective tests across an entire application (writing reusable, effective tests that are not brittle).
