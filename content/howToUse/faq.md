# FAQ

### Why should I Awesome Learn?

Everyone in this industry deals with imposter syndrome. Technologies keep
advancing while we feel like we're falling behind. Saying it out loud is the
first step, changing it is the hard step.

### Who can Awesome Learn?

Anyone at any level is welcome to start a group. We strongly believe learning can be done without an "expert" in the room.

### How does Awesome Learning work?

Anyone can form a team. Once you gather a team,
the team selects the "Track" they want to learn first.
Each track has pre-built hour-long sessions with learning materials and coding
exercises included. We provide completed exercises and learning
annotations to make sure you never get stuck.

### What will this do for my team?

Awesome learning is a research-backed learning platform designed to help small
teams build lasting, foundational skills. The platform is a series of videos and
exercises in one hour intervals divided into subject-matter "tracks". Session
quizzes keep learners engaged, surveys keep leaders up to date with how well
team members are learning. A tight feedback loop drives constant iteration.

### What is a Session?

An Awesome Learning Session is a series of videos and exercises that can be
completed in a single hour.

### What is a Track?

An Awesome Learning Track is a collection of sessions grouped under an umbrella
theme. The specific goal of each session is to help you build a better mental
model of the broader topic.

### How long is the time commitment for a single Track?

A single Track should take no more than a total of 5 work hours to complete. The
recommended cadence is one session or course per week. But you are free to speed
up the process by tackling a new session each day. We do not recommend skipping
a week in-between sessions, as this proved to stagnate learning in the past.
