📚 Exercise 1, Part 1 - Making Inputs Stateful 📚
 
  We've got a form with 3 fields: a person's full 
  name, their phone number, and an email address.
  However, the inputs don't work; when we try to 
  submit the form, it tells us that the fields are 
  empty. If we manage the state of the values with 
  hooks, we can fix this!
 
  🛠️ Make all of the inputs stateful using the useState 
  🛠️ hook. When an input changes (onChange event), it 
  🛠️ should save the value to state. The value of
  🛠️ an input should always come from state

  💡 processForm takes an object of our 3 fields. 
  💡 If any of these fields are missing, it shows 
  💡 an alert to indicate this. If all fields have 
  💡 values when processForm is ran, processForm 
  💡 will show an alert with the contents of the fields

  💡 We provide a "Field" component which reduces some complexity
  💡 in how much code is necessary. Take a look to see how 
  💡 it functions, and what you will need to do to make its 
  💡 value stateful. You do not need to modify the Field component.
