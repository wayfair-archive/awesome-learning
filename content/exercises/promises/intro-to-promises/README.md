Tests are provided for each exercise to give immediate feedback on your progress.
A _solutions_ guide file is also available if you get stuck.

## Intro to Promises
This session is designed to teach you the basics of promises. By the end of this session
you will know how to:   
- [ ] Declare a promise
- [ ] Use resolve and reject
- [ ] Convert a callback function to a promise
- [ ] Handle data response from endpoints within a promise
- [ ] Handle errors within promise chains

## How it Works
1. Open the codesanbox above
2. Ensure you have your test runner open in the codesandbox
3. Read through each exercise description and solve each exercise
4. When your test goes "green", ensure it's not a false positive by mutating your test in some way
5. Check the solution file to compare answers
6. Best if done with a friend or group! Pass the keyboard and mob program it.
