description: React Hooks introduce new ways to use React's APIs and features, while writing less code to do so! But what's the big deal? Why should you care about Hooks? Do you need to refactor all your old code? And why do I see so many people sharing hooks online? This course will introduce engineers to React Hooks, the differences between writing Class Components and Hooked Components, and some common patterns in writing components with Hooks.

  #   title: The useEffect Hook
  #   description: You may be familiar with React's lifecycle methods, which follows from JavaScript's event driven architecture. The useEffect is a similar, but not completely identical, way to instruct React components to run code based on the life, updating, and unmounting of a component. This lesson will introduce you to the useEffect hook, help you debug common problems you may experience in hooks, and help you transition unsafe code to utilize the useEffect hook.
