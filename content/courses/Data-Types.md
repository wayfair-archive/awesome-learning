description: "The focus of this course is to make you familiar with the nuance of the JavaScript Data Types. A little hazy on passing objects by reference? Not sure why your number is coercing to a string? Not sure what coercion is? Then this is the topic for you. Feel at home with the data types and how to make them do what you want by the end of this course"

    description: "Engineers familiar with strictly typed languages like (C++/Java) may find the lack of types in JavaScript shocking. But that is only true on the surface, the truth is that JavaScript has several types. Understanding how they interact together, what they _mean_ will help clear up common misconceptions and make JavaScript seem much more predictable."

    description: "'In JavaScript, **almost** everything is an object' is the phrase which will be the topic of conversation. In this session, we will learn what this means and how to put this new found knowledge into practice."
