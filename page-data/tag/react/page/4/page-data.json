Most would be surprised to know that they are about 50% of the way there with most of their applications just through best practices. Once you have a checklist for creating PWAs, you'll be able to take any web application and apply it regardless of the framework you use.\n\nReact in particular makes it incredibly easy to create PWAs or to update your current React apps and make them PWAs. In this talk, we'll cover the 8 necessary attributes of a PWA, some of the advanced PWA attributes, and how to create/update React apps to make them PWAs. By the end of this talk, attendees should have a concrete understanding of what a PWA is and how to make one with React.\n"}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/tech-talks/react-boston-2019/scalable-design-systems","categorySlug":null},"frontmatter":{"title":"Your Guide to Making Scalable Design Systems","category":null,"description":"Every product is building their design system. However, the challenge comes when you have to build a scalable design system. Recently at my work we have developed a design system in React for 30+ enterprise products. In this talk, I will address:\n\n- Why we decided to have a DS\n\n- How we brought all 30+ product requirements on one page\n\n- How we developed the DS in React to make it scalable\n\n- What our biggest challenges and learnings were\n\n- How we kept 'reusability' of code, 'scaling' of code as well as 'adaption' of new technologies in mind while developing\n\nThis talk is suitable for every developer, product manager, and engineering manager who wants to start with DS or have their own DS too.\n"}}}]}},"pageContext":{"tag":"React","currentPage":4,"coursesLimit":10,"coursesOffset":40,"prevPagePath":"/tag/react/page/3","nextPagePath":"/tag/react/page/5","hasPrevPage":true,"hasNextPage":false}},"staticQueryHashes":["784018950"]}
