Sounds like a good challenge! And this is what I decided to do with my game-making software. This talk will explain all the problems I had and solutions that I used to port my native app written in C++, to a full React + WebAssembly app - while still keeping all existing features!

While transitioning applications to have alternate color modes won't be easy, there are a couple of techniques that developers and designers can use to make it as simple as possible.\n\nIn this session, we will introduce some concepts from color science like luminance, contrast, and chromaticity to help build better, more accessible patterns for color in our applications. We will then look at how to use these patterns in React to build out a sweet looking dark mode for an application.\n\nThis talk is for developers and designers of all skill levels who are thinking about how to build a dark mode for their application or just want to level-up their understanding of color. You will come away with practical patterns to help improve the design consistency and developer experience across light, dark, and every color mode in-between.\n"}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/tech-talks/react-boston-2018/custom-css-inconsistent-ui","categorySlug":null},"frontmatter":{"title":"Custom CSS is the Path to Inconsistent UI","category":null,"description":"Custom CSS is the simplest way to make the UI inconsistent, especially if we’re talking about spacing between UI elements, font sizes or colors. When developers have too much freedom in defining the UI, they will do things differently. The issue could be solved by avoiding any custom CSS on the app level and having a set of primitive components that allow developers to glue UI together in a consistent way.\n"}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/tech-talks/react-boston-2019/react-and-web-platform-delta","categorySlug":null},"frontmatter":{"title":"Deconstructing React and The Web Platform Delta","category":null,"description":"For eons, web developers have paved the path forward for innovation on the web platform. We’ve spawned countless design patterns, APIs, and libraries, all which fill some gap to help us write resilient modern web applications. These early experimentations have often found their way into our native web platform. In the age of JavaScript compilers, React is no exception, and it boldly leaps forward with creative and opinionated solutions on how we productively write performant UI code. In this talk, we’ll deconstruct the virtual DOM, synthetic events, JSX and all the other things that make React unique, helping you understand the cost of this controversial web platform delta.\n"}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/tech-talks/react-boston-2018/deterministic-mocking-with-graphql-apollo","categorySlug":null},"frontmatter":{"title":"Deterministic Mocking with GraphQL and Apollo","category":null,"description":"Tests are an integral part of the development life cycle, but it isn’t always clear what the most efficient way to write them is.

And how the heck do you dynamically mock GraphQL responses with data specific to your tests? ezCater has solved these problems and is happy to announce its newest edition to the open source community: Lunar, a package to help you mock GraphQL data for your integration tests!\n"}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/tech-talks/react-boston-2019/developer-first","categorySlug":null},"frontmatter":{"title":"Developer First – A New Leadership Mindset","category":null,"description":"People don’t leave companies, the saying goes, – they leave managers.\n\nAs a technology leader passionate about the people side of software development, I have always been captivated by the impacts of great and horrible bosses; on the individual, team, and organization.\n\nOrganizations will continue to face an increasingly difficult uphill battle as we try to recruit top technical talent. The unfortunate reality is that there simply are not enough qualified candidates for the increasing demand.\n\nTherefore, there is a dire need to significantly change our approach to leadership if we want to continue building and retaining strong, empowered, motivated, and loyal teams.\n\nEnter Developer First leadership.\n\nDeveloper First leadership is the drive to focus on the growth and advancement of your team members before yourself.\n\nThis approach is centered around the idea that developers should not work for their leaders. Instead, their leaders must work for them!\n\nKate will demonstrate how developer-first leadership can translate directly to the daily lives of technical leaders.\n\nParticipants will leave with tactical methods to truly embrace the human side of software development and serve your teams as intentional, respectable, and inspiring leaders.\n"}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/tech-talks/react-boston-2019/ditch-the-backlog","categorySlug":null},"frontmatter":{"title":"Ditch the Backlog – Stop Sprinting and Start Shaping","category":null,"description":"At this point, most of us have been on at least one team that took agile seriously. You participated in all of the ceremonies, groomed your backlogs, and tracked your team’s velocity. It can often seem like scrum is the only way to build good software. However, there are companies who are successfully building great software without running two-week sprints. Recently, Ryan Singer from the Basecamp team released a book called “Shape Up: Stop Running in Circles and Ship Work that Matters” that explores an alternative to our common agile practices. In this talk, we will cover the main points in Shape Up — from shaping, to betting, to building. You will walk away with a high-level understanding of this successful alternative to agile, and will have everything you need to try it out in your own team.\n"}}}]}},"pageContext":{"tag":"React","currentPage":0,"coursesLimit":10,"coursesOffset":0,"prevPagePath":"/tag/react","nextPagePath":"/tag/react/page/1","hasPrevPage":false,"hasNextPage":true}},"staticQueryHashes":["784018950"]}
