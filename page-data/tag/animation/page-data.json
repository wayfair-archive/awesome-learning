That stuff's important, but there's more to this enchilada!\n\nThis talk focuses on animation performance. We'll dig into why accordions are almost always implemented wrong, dust off some long-forgotten tricks to run just about any animation at 60fps, and explore the bleeding-edge APIs that can help us in this mission.\n"}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/tech-talks/react-boston-2018/whimsy","categorySlug":null},"frontmatter":{"title":"The Case for Whimsy","category":null,"description":"I wish the internet was more fun. The web is an incredible platform, and can do incredible things. This talk looks at novel, quirky, whimsical animations and interactions that make our products better and more enjoyable to use. For example, at Khan Academy, we fill the user’s screen with confetti rain when they get 100% correct on an exercise. I’ll talk about how we drew on 2D physics to make the confetti feel real. Make no mistake; while this talk straddles the line between engineering and UX design, this is very much a React talk. We'll look at how to abstract motion and whimsical behavior into reusable components, how to fold up the DOM like origami, and how to do SVG/canvas animation in a React-friendly way.\n"}}}]}},"pageContext":{"tag":"Animation","currentPage":0,"coursesLimit":10,"coursesOffset":0,"prevPagePath":"/tag/animation","nextPagePath":"/tag/animation/page/1","hasPrevPage":false,"hasNextPage":false}},"staticQueryHashes":["784018950"]}
