We'll look at some of the strengths, weaknesses, and tradeoffs for both hooks and HOCs in general, and what this means for React-Redux users specifically as they decide how to write their applications.\n"}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/tech-talks/react-boston-2018/introducing-undux","categorySlug":null},"frontmatter":{"title":"Introducing Undux – Simple Typesafe State Management for React","category":null,"description":"Listen to Boris Cherny discuss Undux at React Boston 2018!\n"}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/tech-talks/react-boston-2018/lightning-talks-2","categorySlug":null},"frontmatter":{"title":"Lightning Talks - Day 2","category":null,"description":"Featuring Josh Pollock: \"React-powered future at WordPress\", Andrew Kaiser: \"Easter Eggs in the Source\", Cole Turner: \"Render Less: Create Performant Layouts\", and Jason Clark: \"Component Libraries\"\n"}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/tech-talks/react-boston-2019/react-and-elm","categorySlug":null},"frontmatter":{"title":"React and Elm Join Forces","category":null,"description":"The differences between Elm and React with Redux are often framed as a competition, but it doesn’t have to be that way. Coming to React as an experienced Elm developer, I’ll explore what the two share in order to help you better understand the design patterns behind both. I will talk about the problems that the Elm and Redux architectures solve.\n\nI will then outline how Elm's flow compares to Redux's unidirectional data flow, and describe the pros and cons I've seen different teams I've been on encounter when using Elm or React. I will also show how similar reducers in Redux are to Elm update functions, by doing a side-by-side comparison of the same component, built in both React with Redux and in Elm.\n\nFinally, handling synchronous events is built in to React, but there is no one way to handle side effects. I'll give an overview of the main options for React - thunks, sagas, and observables - and will introduce the audience to redux-loop, which borrows from Elm's commands. After this talk, you should have a better understanding of the choices behind the React-Redux and Elm architectures.\n"}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/tech-talks/react-boston-2018/state-of-redux","categorySlug":null},"frontmatter":{"title":"The State of Redux","category":null,"description":"Watch Mark Erikson talk about the state of Redux at React Boston 2018!\n"}}}]}},"pageContext":{"tag":"Redux","currentPage":0,"coursesLimit":10,"coursesOffset":0,"prevPagePath":"/tag/redux","nextPagePath":"/tag/redux/page/1","hasPrevPage":false,"hasNextPage":false}},"staticQueryHashes":["784018950"]}
