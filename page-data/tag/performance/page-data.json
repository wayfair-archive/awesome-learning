We’ve spawned countless design patterns, APIs, and libraries, all which fill some gap to help us write resilient modern web applications. These early experimentations have often found their way into our native web platform. In the age of JavaScript compilers, React is no exception, and it boldly leaps forward with creative and opinionated solutions on how we productively write performant UI code. In this talk, we’ll deconstruct the virtual DOM, synthetic events, JSX and all the other things that make React unique, helping you understand the cost of this controversial web platform delta.\n"}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/tech-talks/react-boston-2018/lightning-talks-1","categorySlug":null},"frontmatter":{"title":"Lightning Talks - Day 1","category":null,"description":"Featuring Erin Fox: \"Learning React Native as a junior engineer\", Shawn Swyx Wang: \"GraphQL and Babel: Blade\", Christina Keelan Cottrell: \"Conquering Lighthouse: Why the largest part of your app is images\", and Autumn Crossan: \"Unit Testing your React components without wanting to tear your hair out later\"\n"}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/tech-talks/react-boston-2018/lightning-talks-2","categorySlug":null},"frontmatter":{"title":"Lightning Talks - Day 2","category":null,"description":"Featuring Josh Pollock: \"React-powered future at WordPress\", Andrew Kaiser: \"Easter Eggs in the Source\", Cole Turner: \"Render Less: Create Performant Layouts\", and Jason Clark: \"Component Libraries\"\n"}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/tech-talks/react-boston-2018/progressive-react","categorySlug":null},"frontmatter":{"title":"Progressive React","category":null,"description":"Listen to Houssein Djirdeh discuss Progressive React at React Boston 2018!\n"}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/tech-talks/react-boston-2019/saving-the-web","categorySlug":null},"frontmatter":{"title":"Saving the Web 16 Milliseconds at a Time","category":null,"description":"When we talk about performance, we generally focus on the initial load experience - the ephemeral period between entering a URL in the address bar and being able to see/interact with the page. That stuff's important, but there's more to this enchilada!\n\nThis talk focuses on animation performance. We'll dig into why accordions are almost always implemented wrong, dust off some long-forgotten tricks to run just about any animation at 60fps, and explore the bleeding-edge APIs that can help us in this mission.\n"}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/tech-talks/react-boston-2018/streaming-react","categorySlug":null},"frontmatter":{"title":"Streaming React for Faster UIs","category":null,"description":"The talk aims to shed some light on two things: a) React DOM's stream renderer that allows React components to be rendered to streams on the server and piped to a browser's response, and b) Browsers' added support for streams that harness their streaming HTML parsers. The way these technologies combine allow the creation of performant, powerful web applications with impressive time-to-interactive metrics.\n"}}}]}},"pageContext":{"tag":"Performance","currentPage":0,"coursesLimit":10,"coursesOffset":0,"prevPagePath":"/tag/performance","nextPagePath":"/tag/performance/page/1","hasPrevPage":false,"hasNextPage":false}},"staticQueryHashes":["784018950"]}
