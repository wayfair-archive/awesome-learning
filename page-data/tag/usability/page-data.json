When engineers create pages, features, and interaction-heavy interfaces for the web, they are often geared towards people who use a traditional keyboard, mouse, and monitor. This course introduces engineers to how they can create more accessible and usable products."}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/courses/Functional-Programming/","categorySlug":"/category/functional-programming/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Functional Programming","category":"Functional Programming","description":"Functional programming is the process of building software by composing pure functions, avoiding shared state, mutable data, and side-effects. Functional programming is declarative rather than imperative, and application state flows through pure functions. Contrast with object oriented programming, where application state is usually shared and colocated with methods in objects. This course introduces engineers to some of the base-level concepts of functional programming."}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/courses/SOLID/","categorySlug":"/category/object-oriented-design/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"SOLID Principles","category":"Object-Oriented Design","description":"Familiarize yourself with the SOLID Design Principles and put them into practice. In the first lesson, walk through a conversational multiple-choice \"quiz\" (great for absolute beginners), and in the second, rewrite principle-violating code in line with the principles. This course assumes you have basic familiarity with Java, though by no means an expert understanding."}}}]}},"pageContext":{"tag":"Usability","currentPage":0,"coursesLimit":10,"coursesOffset":0,"prevPagePath":"/tag/usability","nextPagePath":"/tag/usability/page/1","hasPrevPage":false,"hasNextPage":false}},"staticQueryHashes":["784018950"]}
