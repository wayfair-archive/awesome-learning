Sounds like a good challenge! And this is what I decided to do with my game-making software. This talk will explain all the problems I had and solutions that I used to port my native app written in C++, to a full React + WebAssembly app - while still keeping all existing features! Spoiler alert: At the end, it works.\n"}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/tech-talks/react-boston-2018/building-ar-apps-with-react-native","categorySlug":null},"frontmatter":{"title":"Building AR Apps with React Native","category":null,"description":"With the release of ARKit and ARCore by Apple and Google we see various Augmented reality apps created for iOS and Android.

Because updating an entire codebase in one go can be time consuming, we often like to think that we’ll update our codebase over time. But when development teams are very focused on building new features, it’s hard to remember to update old screens and pages. Codebases often end up with a mix of old and new design.\n\nWouldn't it be nice if we could use ESLint to remind us to update old code? In this lightning talk, I'll talk about how to write ESLint rules to enforce your design system on your codebase. I'll demonstrate how to write rules to:\n\n- Prevent using colors outside of your design system palette\n- Prevent using raw text and button components in favor of your design system components\n- Enforce that components in special directories (like pages or screens) follow the same UI patterns.\n\nThis talk will be in the context of a React Native project, but it's applicable to any React application.\n"}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/tech-talks/react-boston-2019/from-react-to-native","categorySlug":null},"frontmatter":{"title":"From React to Native","category":null,"description":"Watch Laura González talk about using React Native in new, existing, and future code!\n"}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/tech-talks/react-boston-2018/hacking-the-dom","categorySlug":null},"frontmatter":{"title":"Horror Stories From Hacking the DOM Into a Native Platform","category":null,"description":"You don’t go building something like React Native DOM without anticipating a few bruises along the way. Most of its development was a loop of hitting roadblocks and finding “creative” solutions around them. In this talk I’ll highlight some of of the largest roadblocks faced in React Native DOM’s development and the (occasionally absurd) solutions it took to overcome them such as Image’s tintColor prop, layout animations, the back handler, and more.\n"}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/tech-talks/react-boston-2018/lightning-talks-1","categorySlug":null},"frontmatter":{"title":"Lightning Talks - Day 1","category":null,"description":"Featuring Erin Fox: \"Learning React Native as a junior engineer\", Shawn Swyx Wang: \"GraphQL and Babel: Blade\", Christina Keelan Cottrell: \"Conquering Lighthouse: Why the largest part of your app is images\", and Autumn Crossan: \"Unit Testing your React components without wanting to tear your hair out later\"\n"}}}]}},"pageContext":{"tag":"React Native","currentPage":0,"coursesLimit":10,"coursesOffset":0,"prevPagePath":"/tag/react-native","nextPagePath":"/tag/react-native/page/1","hasPrevPage":false,"hasNextPage":false}},"staticQueryHashes":["784018950"]}
