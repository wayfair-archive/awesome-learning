I'll then dive into how to effectively test a react component, first a smaller component, then a \"larger\" component with redux, i18n dependencies, etc., then I will show all of the different APIs that react-testing-library provides, and how to effectively use them. Then, I'll show how to write effective tests across an entire application (writing reusable, effective tests that are not brittle).\n"}}}]}},"pageContext":{"tag":"React Testing Library","currentPage":0,"coursesLimit":10,"coursesOffset":0,"prevPagePath":"/tag/react-testing-library","nextPagePath":"/tag/react-testing-library/page/1","hasPrevPage":false,"hasNextPage":false}},"staticQueryHashes":["784018950"]}
