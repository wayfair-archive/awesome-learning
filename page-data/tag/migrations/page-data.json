Keeping it up to date when it has grown to millions of lines of code or thousands of packages and repositories is harder. Leaning on automation helps, but how do you automate code changes? In this talk, Francois goes over the various parsers and code transformation tools such as Babel, TypeScript, Recast and jscodeshift, where they fit in the ecosystem, and how to use them to automate code changes across hundreds of projects to keep your React (or any other) apps in sync with the rest of the world. Attendees will learn about the various ways to work with JavaScript ASTs (there's a lot!) as well as how to orchestrate migrations and pull requests when manual no longer works.\n"}}}]}},"pageContext":{"tag":"Migrations","currentPage":0,"coursesLimit":10,"coursesOffset":0,"prevPagePath":"/tag/migrations","nextPagePath":"/tag/migrations/page/1","hasPrevPage":false,"hasNextPage":false}},"staticQueryHashes":["784018950"]}
