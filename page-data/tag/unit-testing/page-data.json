Learn some of the Dos & Don'ts when it comes to testing your React app with Apollo components. We’ll explore: When is a unit test appropriate? When should you lean on integration tests? And how the heck do you dynamically mock GraphQL responses with data specific to your tests? ezCater has solved these problems and is happy to announce its newest edition to the open source community: Lunar, a package to help you mock GraphQL data for your integration tests!\n"}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/tech-talks/react-boston-2019/rtl","categorySlug":null},"frontmatter":{"title":"Using React Testing Library to Write Stronger Tests","category":null,"description":"If you had to rewrite your tests when writing a hook in your React application, then you're writing tests wrong.\n\nreact-testing-library is what it sounds like, but more importantly, it encourages writing tests in the way that your end users will be using your components.\n\nIn this talk, I will first introduce react-testing-library, what it is, what it encourages, and what it does best. I'll then dive into how to effectively test a react component, first a smaller component, then a \"larger\" component with redux, i18n dependencies, etc., then I will show all of the different APIs that react-testing-library provides, and how to effectively use them. Then, I'll show how to write effective tests across an entire application (writing reusable, effective tests that are not brittle).\n"}}}]}},"pageContext":{"tag":"Unit testing","currentPage":0,"coursesLimit":10,"coursesOffset":0,"prevPagePath":"/tag/unit-testing","nextPagePath":"/tag/unit-testing/page/1","hasPrevPage":false,"hasNextPage":false}},"staticQueryHashes":["784018950"]}
