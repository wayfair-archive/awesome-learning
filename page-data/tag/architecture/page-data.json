However, the challenge comes when you have to build a scalable design system. Recently at my work we have developed a design system in React for 30+ enterprise products. In this talk, I will address:\n\n- Why we decided to have a DS\n\n- How we brought all 30+ product requirements on one page\n\n- How we developed the DS in React to make it scalable\n\n- What our biggest challenges and learnings were\n\n- How we kept 'reusability' of code, 'scaling' of code as well as 'adaption' of new technologies in mind while developing\n\nThis talk is suitable for every developer, product manager, and engineering manager who wants to start with DS or have their own DS too.\n"}}}]}},"pageContext":{"tag":"Architecture","currentPage":0,"coursesLimit":10,"coursesOffset":0,"prevPagePath":"/tag/architecture","nextPagePath":"/tag/architecture/page/1","hasPrevPage":false,"hasNextPage":false}},"staticQueryHashes":["784018950"]}
