Functional programming is declarative rather than imperative, and application state flows through pure functions. Contrast with object oriented programming, where application state is usually shared and colocated with methods in objects. This course introduces engineers to some of the base-level concepts of functional programming.","tags":["Usability","Maintainability","Functional Programming","Higher Order Functions"],"title":"Functional Programming","lessons":[{"link":"immutability","description":"The first lesson of the Awesome Learning Functional Programming course will teach students how to apply the concept of immutability (the idea that something cannot be modified after being instantiated) to your code and how to avoid common pitfalls in JavaScript.","title":"Immutability"},{"link":"pure-functions","description":"The second lesson of the Awesome Learning Functional Programming course will teach students how to apply the concept of functional purity to your code and how to write and recognize pure functions.","title":"Pure Functions"}]}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/courses/Functional-Programming/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["784018950"]}
