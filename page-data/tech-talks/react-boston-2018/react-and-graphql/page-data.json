With GraphQL we can have an ideal final slide to allow our components to fully encapsulate all of their requirements while keeping things modular and reusable. In this talk we’ll cover both the theory and practice of client development with React and GraphQL, along the way highlighting the areas where we can even more strongly leverage its power and flexibility.\n","date":"September 29, 2018","embedLink":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Qsoj4s_Ml6s","group":"react-boston-2018","tags":["React","React Boston","GraphQL","JavaScript"],"title":"React & GraphQL – Bringing Simplicity to Client Side Development","slides":null,"speakers":[{"name":"Chris Toomey","title":null,"twitter":null}]}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/tech-talks/react-boston-2018/react-and-graphql"}},"staticQueryHashes":["784018950"]}
