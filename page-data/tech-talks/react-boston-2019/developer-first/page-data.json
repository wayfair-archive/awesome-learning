The unfortunate reality is that there simply are not enough qualified candidates for the increasing demand.\n\nTherefore, there is a dire need to significantly change our approach to leadership if we want to continue building and retaining strong, empowered, motivated, and loyal teams.\n\nEnter Developer First leadership.\n\nDeveloper First leadership is the drive to focus on the growth and advancement of your team members before yourself.\n\nThis approach is centered around the idea that developers should not work for their leaders. Instead, their leaders must work for them!\n\nKate will demonstrate how developer-first leadership can translate directly to the daily lives of technical leaders.\n\nParticipants will leave with tactical methods to truly embrace the human side of software development and serve your teams as intentional, respectable, and inspiring leaders.\n","date":"September 21, 2019","embedLink":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ut7jEkIf1ac","group":"react-boston-2019","tags":["React","React Boston","Leadership","Management"],"title":"Developer First – A New Leadership Mindset","slides":null,"speakers":[{"name":"Kate Wardin","title":"Target","twitter":null}]}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/tech-talks/react-boston-2019/developer-first"}},"staticQueryHashes":["784018950"]}
