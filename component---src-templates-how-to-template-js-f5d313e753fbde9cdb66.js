Technologies keep advancing while we feel like we're falling behind. Saying it out loud is the first step, changing it is the hard step.\n"},{question:"Who can Awesome Learn?",answer:'Anyone at any level is welcome to start a group or jump in solo. We strongly believe learning can be done without an "expert" in the room.'},{question:"How does Awesome Learning work?",answer:'Anyone can form a team. Once you gather a team, the team selects the "course" they want to learn first. Each course has pre-built hour-long lessons with learning materials and coding exercises included. We provide completed solutions and learning annotations to make sure you never get stuck.'},{question:"What will this do for my team?",answer:'Awesome learning is a research-backed learning platform designed to help small teams build lasting, foundational skills. The platform is a series of videos, reading materials, and exercises in one hour intervals divided into subject-matter "courses". Reading quizzes keep learners engaged, surveys keep leaders up to date with how well team members are learning. TDD exercises provide a tight feedback loop.'},{question:"What is a Lesson?",answer:"An Awesome Learning lesson is a series of videos, pre-reads, and exercises designed to teach you a specific subject matter within the scope of the course."},{question:"What is a Course?",answer:"An Awesome Learning course is a collection of lessons grouped under an umbrella theme. The specific goal of each lesson is to help you build a better mental model of the broader topic."},{question:"How long is the time commitment for a single Course?",answer:"It varies. Some of our courses contain 2 lessons, others contain 5. The recommended cadence is one lesson or per week. We don't recommend a slower cadence than once per week.
