    question: 'Why should I Awesome Learn?',

      "Everyone in this industry deals with imposter syndrome. Technologies keep advancing while we feel like we're falling behind. Saying it out loud is the first step, changing it is the hard step.\n",

  {
    question: 'Who can Awesome Learn?',
    answer:
      'Anyone at any level is welcome to start a group or jump in solo. We strongly believe learning can be done without an "expert" in the room.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How does Awesome Learning work?',
    answer:
      'Anyone can form a team. Once you gather a team, the team selects the "course" they want to learn first. Each course has pre-built hour-long lessons with learning materials and coding exercises included. We provide completed solutions and learning annotations to make sure you never get stuck.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What will this do for my team?',
    answer:
      'Awesome learning is a research-backed learning platform designed to help small teams build lasting, foundational skills. The platform is a series of videos, reading materials, and exercises in one hour intervals divided into subject-matter "courses". Reading quizzes keep learners engaged, surveys keep leaders up to date with how well team members are learning. TDD exercises provide a tight feedback loop.',

    question: 'What is a Lesson?',
    answer:
      'An Awesome Learning lesson is a series of videos, pre-reads, and exercises designed to teach you a specific subject matter within the scope of the course.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What is a Course?',
    answer:
      'An Awesome Learning course is a collection of lessons grouped under an umbrella theme. The specific goal of each lesson is to help you build a better mental model of the broader topic.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How long is the time commitment for a single Course?',
    answer:
      "It varies. Some of our courses contain 2 lessons, others contain 5. The recommended cadence is one lesson or per week. We don't recommend a slower cadence than once per week. Our experience shows folks lose too much course context when more than a week passes in between lessons.",
