        Awesome Learning is best when run in a group setting. Your group can be
        co-located or remote. Here are some battle-tested ground rules.

      <ul className="HowTo-list">
        <li className="HowTo-listItem">
          Limit the group size to a maximum of 6. Anything more can limit
          individual participation.
        </li>
        <li className="HowTo-listItem">
          Strive to find a group of roughly similar skill levels. This isn't an
          exact science, but mixing highly experienced and in-experienced folks
          together can sometimes lead to being too bored or too challenged on a
          subject.
        </li>
        <li className="HowTo-listItem">
          Set a time commitment early, and get buy-in. Shoot for an hour a week
          meeting with a consistent time and location.

        send out the link to the lesson to your group at least 24 hours in

        Everyone in this industry deals with imposter syndrome. Technologies
        keep advancing while we feel like we're falling behind. Saying it out
        loud is the first step, changing it is the hard step.

        Anyone at any level is welcome to start a group or jump in solo. We
        strongly believe learning can be done without an "expert" in the room.

      <Block is="p" mb="16px">
        Anyone can form a team. Once you gather a team, the team selects the
        "course" they want to learn first. Each course has pre-built hour-long
        lessons with learning materials and coding exercises included. We
        provide completed solutions and learning annotations to make sure you
        never get stuck.

        Awesome learning is a research-backed learning platform designed to help
        small teams build lasting, foundational skills. The platform is a series
        of videos, reading materials, and exercises in one hour intervals
        divided into subject-matter "courses". Reading quizzes keep learners
        engaged, surveys keep leaders up to date with how well team members are
        learning. TDD exercises provide a tight feedback loop.

        An Awesome Learning lesson is a series of videos, pre-reads, and

        An Awesome Learning course is a collection of lessons grouped under an
        umbrella theme. The specific goal of each lesson is to help you build a
        better mental model of the broader topic.

        It varies. Some of our courses contain 2 lessons, others contain 5. The
        recommended cadence is one lesson or per week. We don't reccommend a
        slower cadence than once per week. Our experience shows folks lose too
        much course context when more than a week passes in between lessons.
