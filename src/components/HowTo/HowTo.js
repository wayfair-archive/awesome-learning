          Awesome Learning is best when run in a group setting. Your group can
          be co-located or remote. Here are some battle-tested ground rules.

        <Box m="auto" width="80%">
          <Typography variant="body1" className={classes.paragraphContainer}>
            1. Limit the group size to a maximum of 6. Anything more can limit
            individual participation.
          </Typography>
          <Typography variant="body1" className={classes.paragraphContainer}>
            2. Strive to find a group of roughly similar skill levels. This
            isn't an exact science, but mixing highly experienced and
            in-experienced folks together can sometimes lead to being too bored
            or too challenged on a subject.
          </Typography>
          <Typography variant="body1" className={classes.paragraphContainer}>
            3. Set a time commitment early, and get buy-in. Shoot for an hour a
            week meeting with a consistent time and location.

          Everyone in this industry deals with imposter syndrome. Technologies
          keep advancing while we feel like we're falling behind. Saying it out
          loud is the first step, changing it is the hard step.

        <Typography variant="body1" className={classes.paragraphContainer}>
          Anyone at any level is welcome to start a group or jump in solo. We

        </Typography>
        <Typography variant="body1" className={classes.paragraphContainer}>
          Anyone can form a team. Once you gather a team, the team selects the
          "course" they want to learn first. Each course has pre-built hour-long
          lessons with learning materials and coding exercises included. We
          provide completed solutions and learning annotations to make sure you
          never get stuck.

          Awesome learning is a research-backed learning platform designed to
          help small teams build lasting, foundational skills. The platform is a
          series of videos, reading materials, and exercises in one hour
          intervals divided into subject-matter "courses". Reading quizzes keep
          learners engaged, surveys keep leaders up to date with how well team
          members are learning. TDD exercises provide a tight feedback loop.

          An Awesome Learning lesson is a series of videos, pre-reads, and

          scope of the course.

          An Awesome Learning course is a collection of lessons grouped under an
          umbrella theme. The specific goal of each lesson is to help you build
          a better mental model of the broader topic.

          It varies. Some of our courses contain 2 lessons, others contain 5.
          The recommended cadence is one lesson or per week. We don't reccommend
          a slower cadence than once per week. Our experience shows folks lose
          too much course context when more than a week passes in between
          lessons.
