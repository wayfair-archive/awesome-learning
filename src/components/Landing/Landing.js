        We believe one of the major separators between "junior" and "senior"
        developers is technical communication. That's why we strongly suggest
        running these sessions with a small group, either in person or over a
        chat client.
      </Block>
      <p>
        Over the hundreds of sessions we've run, those who tackle these courses
        as a group learn faster and become stronger technical communicators, all
        while building key technical skills.
